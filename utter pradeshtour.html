               <h4>Agra-Fatehpur Sikri</br></h4>
                
<p>Agra has been immortalized as the City of the Taj. Yet, it doesn’t take much for the roving eye to discover that there’s more to Agra than just the fabled Taj Mahal. The city is a virtual gateway to a world of discovery..a freeze-frame from a resplendent era that’s long since gone by.

In the great epic ‘Mahabharat’ the region of Agra is described as ‘Agraban’ (an integral part of the Braj Bhumi or the land of Lord Krishna). The latter part of Indian history outlines the origin of Agra to 1475 A.D., the reign of Raja Badal Singh.<p>

Literature, cuisine, performing arts and tehzeeb put Lucknow a cut above the rest – and the world acknowledges it.
Among the magnificent monuments are Imambara, Rumi Darwaza, Kaiserbagh Heritage Zone, Residency and Dilkusha.

            <p>A visit to this legendary city will be among the most moving trips you'll ever make.
Varanasi is believed to be the greatest tirth (pilgrimage) between earth and heaven. For a Hindu, to visit Varanasi and bathe in the water of Ganga, is to be cleansed of the sins of thousands of past rebirths.
The combination of Kashi- the holy city, Ganga the holy river and Lord Shiva- the Supreme God, makes Varanasi an immortal destination.
It is a crucible of religious, spiritual and academic thought and beliefs of Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. </p>
