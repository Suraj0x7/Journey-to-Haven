<p>Inaugurated by his contemporary Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi’s erstwhile home has been converted to a simple but engaging museum.The Sabarmati Ashram,at the banks of the namesake river is fragmented into two sections-where Gandhi actually lived,and the modern section conceived by architect Charles Correa. The ashram is ensconced in a peaceful aura,partially due to the reverence that visitors show and possibly due to a unique energy that the place actually has.<p>
