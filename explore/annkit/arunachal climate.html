<p>“The last of the great Shangri-La.." ‘Shangri-La is a mystical, harmonious valley’ or so goes the description in James Hilton’s 1993 novel, Lost Horizon. Hilton went on to describe a Garden of Eden on Earth: a land of milk and honey in a hidden Himalayan valley, where nobody grew old or ugly. Over the years, there’s been no shortage of contenders for the title of ‘Lost Shangri-La’ but now there’s a new kid on the block: Arunachal Pradesh”. The thunderous Himalayan peaks so little known that few have been named, let alone climbed, plus jungles teeming with life forms that scientists are yet to catalogue, delicately tattooed and pierced tribal peoples living in long houses in the forest, magnificent Buddhist Temples and a severe dose of near limitless adventure. Lonely planet’s top 4 regions in the world.

 

<br>Arunachal Pradesh, a veritable treasure house of nature, tucked away in the north eastern tip of India, invites you to relax in its picturesque hills and vales encircled on three sides by Bhutan, China and Myanmar. Come to Arunachal Pradesh to relive in nature in its full splendour. Enjoy the salubrious climate and meet its simple and hospitable people.
