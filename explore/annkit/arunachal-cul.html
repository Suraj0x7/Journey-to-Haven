   <center>

Known as the 'The Land of Dawnlit Mountains', Arunachal Pradesh finds mention in prominent scriptures of India, such as the Kalika Purana and Mahabharata. Sage Parashurama washed away his sins in Arunachal which was then known as Prabhu Mountains. Sage Vyasa meditated in the forests of this region and Lord Krishna married Rukmini at this legendary site of India. </p>

        The second group comprises of Adis, Akas, Apatanis, Bangnis, Mijis, Mishmis, Nishis and Thongsas, the worshipers of Sun and Moon God.

    <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/View_of_cardamom_plantation_20200123123628.jpg">
    <p>Agriculture is the main occupation of Arunachal Pradesh's people. Jhum cultivation is the major occupation practised by the farmers. Jhuming involves cleaning a portion of the forest by cutting down and burning the trees and then sowing seeds on those areas with the help of poker. Many farmers have been relying on this form of agriculture for their livelihood for years now.
        Majority of the land in the state is covered with dense forest and lands. These forests provide products and industries are based on processing them, which gives employment and income to a large number of population. Most of the industries in the state are based on natural products from forests like timber and plywood.
        Other industries also include tea, petrochemical and cement. Fruit cultivation is also practised in some parts of Arunachal. It has become a significant sector for fruit cultivation and horticulture. This sector has been providing income to many farmers too.</p>

    <p>Arunachal Pradesh being a tribal-state has unique social customs. These include the many rituals performed during a wedding celebration. These rituals continue for a time span of four to five days and are meant to invoke love and trust in the relationship of not just the couple, but the two families involved.
        The marriages can be of two types, either an arranged marriage, known as Aaw Lang Aaw or a situation of eloping known as Thok No Chaii. In the latter case, the groom is allowed to enter the village only after performing the sacrifice of the native fauna, which is conducted by a priest.
        The wedding celebrations start with the groom's family gearing and packing up for spending four nights at the bride's home. As per the customs, they move to the hilltop on their way and shout 'Ho' to indicate their arrival. They are welcomed with a grand treat.</p>
