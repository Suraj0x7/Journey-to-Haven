   <div> <h1>Customs And Traditions of Uttar Pradesh</h1></div>
   <center><p>The people of Uttar Pradesh follow a large number of traditions and customs. The Hindu culture considers it auspicious to take a dip in the holy waters at least once in a lifetime. They believe it cleanses them of their sins. Uttar Pradesh has a lot of ghats to take the holy dip in. Allahabad has the world-renowned Sangam, which is the confluence of the holy rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. In addition to flushing away sins, it is also believed to free you from the cycle of rebirth.

<p>Varanasi also has a number of ghats. The ghats are the prime attraction of the city and are popular among the pilgrims. A dip in the holy waters here brings salvation. Some of the major ghats have grand Ganga aartis performed in the evening.

    Aarti is another important ritual followed at the ghats. These are basically prolonged poojas and involve lighting of fire or yajna. The devotees believe in doing so all evils and ill-wills are thrown apart. The Hindus perform these poojas before starting any new endeavour because these bring good luck and prosperity.</p>
