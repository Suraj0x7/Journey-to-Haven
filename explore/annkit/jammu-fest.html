   <div> <h1>Festivals In Jammu And Kashmir</h1></div>
   <center>
       The state of Jammu and Kashmir has diverse cultural traditions. The three provinces of the Indian state are Kashmir, Jammu, and Ladakh, and each is different than the next. This fascinating diversity is also apparent in the festivals in Jammu and Kashmir that are most popular in each of these regions. From the point of view of an outsider, fairs and festivals represent a crash course in the culture of a people. Keeping this in mind, here is a list of the most famous festivals in Jammu And Kashmir.<br><br>
        <h2>1. Galdan Namchot</h2>

    <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2018/08/Spituk-Gustor-Zanskar.jpg">

Gustor stands for sacrifices made on the penultimate day of the month, and the festival is celebrated on the 30th and 31st October of every year. The festival is marked by special early morning prayers.

        Visitors can witness the reenactment of the killing of the anti-Buddhist emperor of Tibet Langdarma by Buddhist monks. At the end of the festival, the sacrificial cake Torma is eaten. The cake itself is distributed by the monk who leads the Black Hat dancers. Amongst the most charming and ritualistic festivals in Jammu and Kashmir, Gustor represents the victory of good over evil. Those of you who want to witness the culture of Jammu and Kashmir can plan a trip to Ladakh during the time.

Celebrated every 12 years at the Hemis Monastery at Hemis (about 45 kilometres from Leh), the festival honours Lord Padmasambhava, known as Guru Rinpoche in the region. The ritualistic festival is believed to bring spiritual and physical health to people. The ceremony is elaborate and features several ceremonial Tibetan items.

Hemis is probably the most colorful festival celebrated in Jammu and Kashmir.

    <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2018/08/Losar.jpg">
    <p>The Ladakhi king Jamyang Namgyal was once told that he should postpone his war against Skardu until the end of winter, which was the traditional start of the new year throughout Tibet. However, the king decided to celebrate the new year two months early instead, and Ladakh has since marked the new year festival of Losar early.

        Losar is traditionally celebrated for 15 days and is one of the famous festivals celebrated in Jammu and Kashmir. A decoratory sheep’s head is made from colored butter, and incense made from rhododendron and juniper is commonly used in Ladakhi homes.
        
        Losar Date 2021: 24 – 26 February</p>

    <p>This is a modern day festival meant as a celebration of the Sindhu River as a symbol of the oneness of the various strands that make the country. Since 1997, the Sindhu Darshan has happened every year on the banks of the Indus in Shey near Leh. Visitors immerse water from rivers near their homes into the Sindhu in a ceremony organised by a joint group of religious organisations. Later, monks pray on the banks and there is a bonfire at night.
