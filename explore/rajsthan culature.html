    <p>Bright colours, intricate designs, mirror works, and chunks of silver or other pieces of jewellery are the most important elements of Rajasthani attires. Be it the men or the women, they all love to adorn themselves in thwe most colourful ways while being grounded to their tradition and cultural values.

        Since the state is dotted with a diverse range of cultures, dressing among the locals vary from according to their region. However, they showcase a striking range of similarities. Men usually love to don colourful turbans called ‘pagri’; the Jodhpuri Safa and Jaipuriya Pagri are the two most popular variants of pagris used in Rajasathan.
        
        While in some places, ‘dhotis’ are considered to be the primary wear, ‘pyjamas’ can also be seen in most of the places as the traditional attire for the lower portion of the body. Rajasthani men are also inclined towards ‘kurta’ or a traditional dress called ‘angrakha’ that resembles much to the frocks worn by ladies.
        
        Women in Rajasthan has a strong bond with colourful clothing and classical jewelleries. While ‘sari’ is considered as the most traditional women-wear, women in the ‘Desert Capital’ of India loves to wear colourful ‘ghagras’. Usually worn from the waist, this skirt-type dress reaches till the ankle. They mostly prefer hand-printed, block-printed, or dyed ghagras along with a blouse called ‘cholis’. Be it the ghagra or the cholis, they are never complete without matching set of jewelleries. In some cases, you would also find ghagras laced with precious metals, stones, or even diamonds!</p>
