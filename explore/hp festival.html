<div class="city">


<p><br>The Minjar Fair is an important occasion in the lives of the people of Chamba and it is celebrated with great zeal and enthusiasm. An agricultural festival, the Minjar Fair is an event of joy and prosperity. According to Indian history, when the Raja of Chamba was coming back to Chamba after defeating the King of Trigarta, now known as Kangra (another district in Himachal Pradesh), in the year 935 A.D., he was given a warm welcome by the people who greeted him with bundles of paddy and maize. This was the first time the Minjar Mela was held and celebrated.

<br>Nowadays, the fair is organized as soon as the young paddy and the maize shoots emerge from the soil. The distribution of Minjar, which is a silk tassel worn on the front parts of a dress by men and women alike, marks the beginning of the fair. The tassel symbolizes maize and paddy shoots which can be widely seen in this region during this time of the year. People visiting this busy town during this occasion wear the symbol of Minjar, which comprises a corn cob made of silk. If you visit this town during this occasion, you can witness the spellbinding sights of the colorful attires and fancy costumes worn by the people here. The people thank the Almighty for the good yield during this auspicious occasion and ask for His blessings. Coconuts, seasonal fruits and a 'Minjar', comprised of sheafs of paddy and golden silk wrapped in a red fabric, are offered to God. In earlier times, a buffalo was also sacrificed to appease the Deity but this practice has now been discontinued. It was believed by the locals that sacrificial offering of the buffalo to the Ravi River would make them aware of their fortunes. If the buffalo got washed away by the river current, then it was considered a good omen.

<br>The main highlights of the Minjar fair are its mesmerizing folk music and dance performances. A large section of the town is dotted with numerous stalls during the Minjar Fair, and this also makes Chamba a haven for shopaholics.
