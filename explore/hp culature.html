    <p>Himachal Pradesh is a multireligious, multicultural as well as a multilingual state like other Indian states. In the south of the Greater Himalayas, the presence of Hinduism is strong. In the middle hills, rustic customs appear in worship or many local ‘gods’ and ‘goddess’. In Trans Himalaya, Buddhism has progressed successfully for more than 1,000 years. The presence of Christianity comes with the coming of the British and there are more than a dozen churches in this area in the state. Similarly, there are many places in the entire state which are sacred by the Sikhs. Islam records its presence in Nahan and some of the major cities around.

        Cultural and geographically, there are three well-defined areas of the state. ‘Adivasi belt’ belongs to Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti districts, it is largely Buddhist and the language is related to the Himalayan Belt of Tibetan-Burmese. The middle belts embrace this band and are characterized by wild hills and farmland valleys – with slopes, villages, farms, and orchards. Sub-healthy people of Himachal practice farming and this region is traditionally the largest concentration of population. Culture has been fostered by discrete people who live harmoniously on the same land.</p>
