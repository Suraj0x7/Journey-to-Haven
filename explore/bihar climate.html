<br><p>During the heavy monsoon (July to September) the northern districts should be avoided from the itinerary as the region is prone to occasional floods due to the multiple rivers and nearness to the Himalayan range. The rainfall (over 1400 mm) along the Sub – Himalayan zone falling under the district West Champaran has numerous water bodies along with the rivers Gandak and Kosi and small rivulets. The southern districts are pleasant during monsoon and the rains come in short spells making it enjoyable fresh natural showers</p>
