       <h2>Rajasthani Cuisines</h2>
       <p>Rajasthani cooking was influenced by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in this arid region. Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking.</p>

   <p>Famous dishes which Rajasthan is known for are Dal-Bati-Churma, Bikaneri Bhuji, bajre ki roti (millet bread) and lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), mawa kachori Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori and ghevar from Jodhpur, Alwar ka Mawa(Milk Cake), malpauas from Pushkar and rassgollas from Bikaner.</p>

   <p>The Ghoomer dance is performed on various auspicious occasions like fairs & festivals. It is called `Ghoomer`, from the `ghoomna` of Ghaghra i.e. the flowing of Ghaghra, a long skirt of the Rajasthani women. There is an amazing grace as the skirt flair slowly while the women folk twirl in circles, their faces covered with the help of the veil. The performers in Ghoomar dance sway their colorful ghagras that are rich in embroidery work and it is also embellished with mirror-work. They are dressed in the traditional ghaghra and choli with chunaris. They deck up in traditional silver jewelry and glass bangles. The Ghoomar is performed during womenâ€™s gatherings like the ritual of haldi during a wedding, or to entertain a queen in her personal quarters, etc.</p>
