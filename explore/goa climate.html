<br><p>Winter in Goa is a time of great celebration and by far the best time to visit Goa! When the monsoons end, Goa looks like it's just back from the laundry - every tree and building looks spanking clean. The Goa weather at this time is just perfect and the streets begin to fill up with thousands of holidaymakers, out for their fix of fun, sun and sand. People can pick from a host of watersports as the water is just right at this time of the year. Winter in Goa is a fun season with fairs, parades, festivals and parties that wind up late in the night on the beaches. It is a festive couple of months and all hotels, restaurants and shops are decorated with lights, stars, tinsel and Christmas trees. Also this is the period when maximum weddings and engagements are held in Goa. Hotels are packed to capacity so be sure to book in advance. January is a bit chilly but it is never too cold here. It's good to have a sweater with you if you plan to bike around at night or early in the morning. Don't forget to watch out for the beautiful mists that swirl around the paddy fields and all surrounding streets in the mornings and at night...its gorgeous!

<br><p>The monsoons in Goa typically last from June to September. This is the season during which people avoid Goa, simply because people associate Goa with beaches, sun and sand, and therefore, a rainy day is a huge letdown for beach bums. Unfortunately for them, they don't know what they're missing out on, for Goa is beautiful during the rains! The rainy season in Goa is a magical experience. After the harsh heat of May, the smell of wet earth is incomparable. Paddy fields are at their peak as the scorched, dry land gets infused with a new breath of life. If you're interested in a beautiful and relaxed holiday, with no noise, no crowds and lots of soul searching time, choose Goa in the rains. The entire state is sparkling clean, emerald green, and above all, devoid of hordes of tourists! During the monsoons, Goa receives an average of three to five hours of sunshine during the day. We advise against venturing out into the sea at this time. Not only is the water freezing cold, it is also extremely dangerous during the rains. Explore the many spice plantations, Mollem National Park and Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary to make most of the magic of the monsoons</p>

<br><p><b>Mid-November to Mid-February:</b> These are the best months to visit the party capital since the weather is pleasantly cool and comfortable. It’s the perfect time to relax on the beaches amidst other tourists who make the most of these three months in Goa. December is the time when Goa witnesses one of its most popular festivals, Sunburn, besides extensive Christmas and New Year celebrations and is home to lakhs of visitors from across the world. You might want to book your hotels in advance since this is the peak season and prices of accommodation go way higher than you would imagine.
