<br><p>Himachal Pradesh is often considered a summer holiday spot because even though the rest of the country faces sweltering heat during the months of May and June, the many towns and hill stations of Himachal Pradesh offer a respite. Many people consider summer to be the best time to visit Himachal, especially places such as McLeod Ganj and Dharamshala. 

<br>Summer here lasts from March to June and the climate is pleasant with just a few thunderstorms and pre-monsoon showers cooling down the temperature further.

<br><p>Monsoon in Himachal Pradesh is from July to September. The hills turn a lush green from all sides and Dalhousie gets most of the rain. However, although the rain turns the state mesmerising, there is an increased danger of landslides at this time so it’s always better to be forewarned. While not so great for adventure seekers as trekking and hiking are not allowed, monsoon might actually be the best time to visit Himachal for honeymooners and couples. 

<br>Nature’s bounty is splendid during this season and with the light mist and beautiful atmosphere, you will have an unforgettable holiday if you visit Spiti, Kinnaur, Kasauli or McLeod Ganj. Most often, people avoid visiting Himachal Pradesh during the monsoons because of the unexpectedness of the rainfall and the possibility of landslides. But train and flight fares are relatively lower, and hotels offer off-season discounts. Remember to carry an umbrella and a few warm clothes as it can get quite cool when it rains.

<br>Himachal Pradesh in the monsoons is like tonic for the soul. If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t mind a few inconveniences such as getting wet in a sudden downpour, you will love visiting Himachal during the rains. The fine mist in the air, the sudden chill that makes you shiver, the brilliant verdant green of the tree covered mountains – all these will surely be imprinted on your mind for a long time. </p>
