   <div> <h1>Gujarati Dishes</h1></div>
<center>
   <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DP1.jpg">
   <p>A burst of flavors, an array of colors, and a sweet tinge constitutes irresistible Gujarati dishes. Welcome to a part of India that not only is fond of food but cherishes it as a way of living. To think that Gujarati food is enjoyed worldwide is a testament to the fact how Gujarati cuisine has hit the right notes with people all around the world. It’s only fitting that a culture which prides itself on being welcoming, eccentric, and full of life have at least a hint of sweetener in everything they consume.</p>
   <h2>1. Khandvi: Soft Layers</h2>
   <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2018/02/Khandvi.jpg">
   <p>Soft, mushy, light and delightful. Khandvi is one of the most likable Gujarati breakfast recipes a person can have. Khandvi gives an irresistible sweet and salty taste with a batter that consists of gram flour, salt, and sugar. Another name given to it in Marathi is ‘Suralichya vadya’ as it is adorned by Gujaratis and Maharashtrians alike.

   <h2>2. Dhokla: Spongy Squares
</h2>
   <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2018/02/Dhokla.jpg">
   <p>Arguably the most recognizable Gujarati food, Dhokla is one of the most frequently consumed Gujarati dishes in the world. Be it early morning, late afternoon, or evening- it’s always the right time for Gujarati cuisine lovers to eat Dhokla.

    A spongy dish made of fermented rice and chickpeas, Dhokla is best consumed with Green Chutney (made of coriander or mint) or Meethi Chutney (made of Dates and Tamarind). Another delicious sweet and salty Gujarati cuisine, Dhokla is often consumed after frying it with mustard, cumin seeds, and curry leaves to add a rich aroma to the dish.</p>
   <h2>3. Handvo: Sweet & Savoury Cake</h2>
   <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2018/02/Handvo.jpg">
   <p>Handvo is a sweet and savory cake that gives depth of flavors and creativity to Gujarati cuisine. The vegetable cake is made with a filling of bottle gourd, crushed peanuts, and sometimes an assortment of other vegetables added according to taste.

    The cake is considered slightly similar to Dhokla in terms of texture, but where it differentiates is in taste. For the preparation of Handvo, Gujaratis use a different type of pressure cooker to make the dish after applying a tadka of oil, cumin seeds, mustard, and curry leaves.</p>
   <h2>4. Gathiya: Besan Snack</h2>
   <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2018/02/Gathiya.jpg">
   <p>Straight out of the Gujarati dry snacks recipes book comes Gathiya- a deep-fried snack made of chickpea flour. The snack, after preparation, is soft, not crisp, and retains its powdery texture. Since Gujarati dishes are incomplete without a few sweeteners, the alternative version of this snack is called Mitha Gathiya. This dish is often consumed by people while having tea in the morning, or in the evening.</p>
   <h2>5. Thepla: Like Thin Parathas</h2>
   <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2018/02/Thepla.jpg">
   <p>A very commonly consumed Gujarati food, Thepla is a flatbread prepared in multiple variations like with fenugreek leaves, wheat flour, or cumin seeds. With a right combination of ingredients in the Thepla dough, the dish comes out with a vibrant flavor that is near impossible to ignore. Combined with add-ons like curds and chunda, Theplas are a popular portable dish that can be consumed hot or cold while traveling.</p>
