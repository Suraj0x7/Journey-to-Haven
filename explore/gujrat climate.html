<p> Climatically, a year in Gujarat can be divided into three seasons, the winter from November to February, the summer from March to May and monsoon season from June to September, with October being the intervening month. There is a great diversity in the climatic conditions across the state of Gujarat with different parts having markedly disparate climatic conditions. The places that lie near the coasts are humid whereas the ones lying in the interiors experience a completely different climatic condition. The Rann of Kutch region suffers an extreme climate where the summers are extremely hot while the winters are too cold. On the other hand, the coastal regions and the eastern belt of Gujarat experience a mild and pleasant climatic condition with moderate rainfall during the monsoons. Continue reading to learn more about the overall climatic condition and the geographical location of Gujarat.

<img src="https://www.visittnt.com/images/gujarat/gujarat-tourism.jpg" width="500" height="300"></center>
<br><p>The best time to visit Gujarat is during the winter season, i.e. between October and February. Since it is a dry region and experiences high temperatures and humidity; visiting the state in the monsoons (July to September) may also be a good idea especially in the regions that receive less or no rainfall. During summers, i.e. between March and June, the temperature soars high, making it difficult for travellers to explore most of the attractions, but there are some places worth visiting like the Saputara Hill Station and the natural reserves that provide quite some respite in the scorching heat.
