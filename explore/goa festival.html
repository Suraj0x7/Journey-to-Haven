        <h2>1. Goa Carnival</h2>
    <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/maxresdefault(3)_20180409163444.jpg">
    <p>Goa Carnival, the most fun-filled festival in Goa,  is meant to be a feast of food, drinks, music, dance and fun - before the 40 day period of fasting and absenteeism of meat in the month of Lent. The days are marked by colourful and musical parades which initiate in the capital Panaji and travel throughout the state making it one of the most popular festivals of Goa. The evenings are kept for gala balls, and people engage in partying on the streets all through the night. The float parade in Panaji is led by King Momo, who floats a specially decorated float to declare the initiation of eating, drinking and partying.

        Though the Carnival was on a decline in the past few years, yet the efforts of Goa Tourism Department and the state government have ensured that not only is the festival revived but also contributes to attracting tourists for the state. The Carnival just cannot be missed.

    <p>New Year stands for Party, and Party Stands for Goa. There's no other place in the country which is livelier than Goa. The whole state is indulged in celebrations the entire night. There can be no limit for the level of crazy that this state can put during the New Year's celebration. In spite of the most famous music festivals; Sunburn and Supersonic moved out of the state, the state does not seem to have been affected by it. The celebrations have increased exponentially and the regular party spots like Hill Top, Anjuna, Baga, Palolem, Agonda and all other spots that humans could party in are filled with celebrations.

        The best part, of course, is the night of New Year when the whole party-state stops their thumping Bass and Trance filled music just to count down with the clock to strike the midnight 12. Right at 12, the festivities reach the sky with the fireworks, Champaigns and Music booming in the air with the wooing crowd jumping to every beat.</p>
