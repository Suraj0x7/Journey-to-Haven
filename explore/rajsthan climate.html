<p>The climate in India keeps varying as per the latitude, altitude and season. Now, coming to Rajasthan, the climate here keeps varying because of its topography. It is the driest region in India. Rajasthan is located in the north western part of India and thus, it is more prone to different climatic changes. While the western part of Rajasthan is dry and infertile, the southwestern part is hilly and wet.

<br>The climate of Rajasthan keeps varying throughout the state. In the desert areas, it is usually hot and dry in summer and cold during the winters. Coming to the Aravali range, to the west, both rainfall and humidity are low. While to the east, weather can be characterized by high humidity and better rainfall. Below, we have further discussed about the climate in Rajasthan by dividing it into four seasons: Summer, Monsoon, Post-Monsoon and Winter. </p>
<br><h2>1.<b> Summer</b></h2>

<br><p>The hottest season of Rajasthan, summer, extends from April to June. The temperature in this season ranges from 32° C to 45° C. The only place in Rajasthan that is a little cool in summers is the hill station, Mt Abu. However, the nights in Rajasthan are pretty cool, with the night temperature falling considerably.With the apparent northward movement of the sun towards the Tropic of Cancer in March, temperatures start rising in north India. April, May and June are the months of summer in north India.

Dry and hot winds known as ‘Loo’, blow in the afternoon, and very often, they continue to well into midnight. Dust storms in the evening are very common in May for south-eastern areas and in June for north-western part of state. Ganganagar has about 27 days of dust-storm followed by Bikaner and Jodhpur.</p>
